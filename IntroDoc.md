Dear Students,

We look forward to meeting you on the evening of July 12th, and to a productive two weeks thereafter. Below are a few things you should know prior to your arrival. You can also consult this source [CSHL blog post](https://currentexchange.cshl.edu/blog/2018/3/cshlcourselife-banbury) for additional info. 

# What to Pack:
Here is a list of items to bring. Keep in mind the summer temperatures and humidity. 

-	All anticipated medications
-	Sunscreen
-	Hair dryer  
-	Umbrella or rain poncho
-	Flip flops or slides (for the shower)
-	Toothpaste and toothbrush
-	Conditioner
- Lots of bug spray
-	Sweater or sweatshirt (even if you are attending a summer course or workshop)
-	Bathing suit
-	Recreational gear
-	Running shoes if that’s your thing. There is a very nice running trail, which leads to the beach.
-	Close-toed shoes if wet feet are not your thing. You will walk across a stretch of wet grass daily on your way from the dorms to the lecture hall.

You don’t need to bring Shampoo, soap, or towels/bedding as these will be provided for you. 
If you forget anything or new needs arise, the nearest grocery store (open 24 hours a day) is 3 miles away. A few times a week the TAs will take the van, and a shopping list, and buy requested items from the grocery store/liquor store in town.

There are washers and dryers in the basement of one of the dorm buildings (Sammis Hall). Laundry detergent is available.

As far as laptops: Feel free to bring your own laptop for personal use. However, you will use desktop workstations pre-loaded with necessary software for the duration of the course.

# Getting to Banbury Center:
The CSHL blog has a detailed [travel section](https://currentexchange.cshl.edu/blog/2018/3/cshlcourselife-banbury#travel-tips-notes) which includes instructions on how to get to Banbury Conference Center (18 Banbury Ln, Llyod Harbor), as opposed to the CSHL main campus which is elsewhere. For those of you arriving at the LIRR station, make sure to look out for other folk that may be attending the course so you can share a cab to the conference center.

 
Once you arrive at the Banbury Center, head to the Robertson House, where you will be greeted by the wonderful Basia (pronounced ‘Ba-sha’). She will give you an information packet and the key-card to your room. Please make every effort not to lose your key-card, it is a pain to get a replacement. 


# Housing and meals at Banbury Center:
You will be staying in either Sammis Hall or the Robertson house. Housing is assigned by gender by CSHL, and most people will be in a shared room or suite, with a shared bathroom. 

Meals are served during the following hours and at these locations:  

- Breakfast in Robertson House: 7:30 AM - 9:00 AM
- Lunch in Meier House or Conference Center: 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM
- Dinner in Robertson House: 6:00 PM – 7:00 PM
